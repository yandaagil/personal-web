# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) bring a new way to render components on the server, improving performance and reducing client-side JavaScript.

## Benefits of RSC

- **Less JavaScript on the Client**: Since some components render on the server, the client-side bundle size is reduced.
- **Improved SEO**: Server-rendered content is more accessible to search engines.
- **Faster Initial Load**: Pages can load faster with server-rendered components.

React Server Components are still evolving, but they offer a promising future for React applications.
